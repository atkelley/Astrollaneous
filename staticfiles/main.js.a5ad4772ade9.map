Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\n *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\n *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\n *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\n *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\n *\n * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\n *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\n *\n *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\n *    |------|------|------|\n *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\n *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\n *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\n *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\n *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\n *\n * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\n *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\n *\n * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `t`: seconds timestamp\n *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 8. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 9. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx\")\n *   ```\n *\n * - New format string API for `format` function\n *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).\n *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.\n *\n * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.\n *\n * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date\n * @param {String} format - the string of tokens\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

format string.\n *\n * > ⚠️ Please note that the `format` tokens differ from Moment.js and other libraries.\n * > See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * The characters in the format string wrapped between two single quotes characters (') are escaped.\n * Two single quotes in a row, whether inside or outside a quoted sequence, represent a 'real' single quote.\n *\n * Format of the format string is based on Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n * https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table\n * with a few additions (see note 5 below the table).\n *\n * Not all tokens are compatible. Combinations that don't make sense or could lead to bugs are prohibited\n * and will throw `RangeError`. For example usage of 24-hour format token with AM/PM token will throw an exception:\n *\n * ```javascript\n * parse('23 AM', 'HH a', new Date())\n * //=> RangeError: The format string mustn't contain `HH` and `a` at the same time\n * ```\n *\n * See the compatibility table:

but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\n *      as wide as the sequence\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\n *\n *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\n *\n *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\n *\n *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\n *\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\n *    on the given locale.\n *\n *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\n *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\n *\n * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\n *\n * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\n * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `referenceDate` which works as a context of parsing.\n *\n * `referenceDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\n * If you're not sure which `referenceDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\n * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\n * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\n * If `referenceDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\n * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n *\n * The result may vary by locale.\n *\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\n *\n * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\n * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\n * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\n *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   toDate('2016-01-01')\n *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\n *   ```\n *\n * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\n * @param {Date|Number} referenceDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object. See [Locale]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/Locale}\n * @param {0|1|2|3|4|5|6} [options.weekStartsOn=0] - the index of the first day of the week (0 - Sunday)\n * @param {1|2|3|4|5|6|7} [options.firstWeekContainsDate=1] - the day of January, which is always in the first week of the year\n * @param {Boolean} [options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens=false] - if true, allows usage of the

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 1 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n *   exiting:  { opacity: 0 },\n *   exited:  { opacity: 0 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = /*#__PURE__*/function (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ? props.enter : props.appear;\n    var initialStatus;\n    _this.appearStatus = null;\n\n    if (props.in) {\n      if (appear) {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n        _this.appearStatus = ENTERING;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = ENTERED;\n      }\n    } else {\n      if (props.unmountOnExit || props.mountOnEnter) {\n        initialStatus = UNMOUNTED;\n      } else {\n        initialStatus = EXITED;\n      }\n    }\n\n    _this.state = {\n      status: initialStatus\n    };\n    _this.nextCallback = null;\n    return _this;\n  }\n\n  Transition.getDerivedStateFromProps = function getDerivedStateFromProps(_ref, prevState) {\n    var nextIn = _ref.in;\n\n    if (nextIn && prevState.status === UNMOUNTED) {\n      return {\n        status: EXITED\n      };\n    }\n\n    return null;\n  } // getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps) {\n  //   let nextStatus = null\n  //   if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n  //     const { status } = this.state\n  //     if (this.props.in) {\n  //       if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = ENTERING\n  //       }\n  //     } else {\n  //       if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n  //         nextStatus = EXITING\n  //       }\n  //     }\n  //   }\n  //   return { nextStatus }\n  // }\n  ;\n\n  var _proto = Transition.prototype;\n\n  _proto.componentDidMount = function componentDidMount() {\n    this.updateStatus(true, this.appearStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentDidUpdate = function componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    var nextStatus = null;\n\n    if (prevProps !== this.props) {\n      var status = this.state.status;\n\n      if (this.props.in) {\n        if (status !== ENTERING && status !== ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = ENTERING;\n        }\n      } else {\n        if (status === ENTERING || status === ENTERED) {\n          nextStatus = EXITING;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    this.updateStatus(false, nextStatus);\n  };\n\n  _proto.componentWillUnmount = function componentWillUnmount() {\n    this.cancelNextCallback();\n  };\n\n  _proto.getTimeouts = function getTimeouts() {\n    var timeout = this.props.timeout;\n    var exit, enter, appear;\n    exit = enter = appear = timeout;\n\n    if (timeout != null && typeof timeout !== 'number') {\n      exit = timeout.exit;\n      enter = timeout.enter; // TODO: remove fallback for next major\n\n      appear = timeout.appear !== undefined ? timeout.appear : enter;\n    }\n\n    return {\n      exit: exit,\n      enter: enter,\n      appear: appear\n    };\n  };\n\n  _proto.updateStatus = function updateStatus(mounting, nextStatus) {\n    if (mounting === void 0) {\n      mounting = false;\n    }\n\n    if (nextStatus !== null) {\n      // nextStatus will always be ENTERING or EXITING.\n      this.cancelNextCallback();\n\n      if (nextStatus === ENTERING) {\n        this.performEnter(mounting);\n      } else {\n        this.performExit();\n      }\n    } else if (this.props.unmountOnExit && this.state.status === EXITED) {\n      this.setState({\n        status: UNMOUNTED\n      });\n    }\n  };\n\n  _proto.performEnter = function performEnter(mounting) {\n    var _this2 = this;\n\n    var enter = this.props.enter;\n    var appearing = this.context ? this.context.isMounting : mounting;\n\n    var _ref2 = this.props.nodeRef ?

Making',\r\n        description: `Astronomers using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes have put together a detailed map of a rare collision between four galaxy clusters. Eventually all four clusters — each with a mass of at least several hundred trillion times that of the Sun — will merge to form one of the most massive objects in the universe. Galaxy clusters are the largest structures in the cosmos that are held together by gravity. Clusters consist of hundreds or even thousands of galaxies embedded in hot gas, and contain an even larger amount of invisible dark matter. Sometimes two galaxy clusters collide, as in the case of the Bullet Cluster, and occasionally more than two will collide at the same time. The new observations show a mega-structure being assembled in a system called Abell 1758, located about 3 billion light-years from Earth. It contains two pairs of colliding galaxy clusters that are heading toward one another. Scientists first recognized Abell 1758 as a quadruple galaxy cluster system in 2004 using data from Chandra and XMM-Newton, a satellite operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). Each pair in the system contains two galaxy clusters that are well on their way to merging. In the northern (top) pair seen in the composite image, the centers of each cluster have already passed by each other once, about 300 to 400 million years ago, and will eventually swing back around. The southern pair at the bottom of the image has two clusters that are close to approaching each other for the first time.`,\r\n        author: 'X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/G.Schellenberger et al.; Optical:SDSS',\r\n        isImage: true,\r\n        hdUrl: '/static/mySpaceStuff/img/backup_image_large.jpg',\r\n        url: '/static/mySpaceStuff/img/backup_image.jpg'\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <Fragment>\r\n        { this.state.isLoaded ?\r\n          <div className=\"container main-container\">\r\n            <div className=\"row\">\r\n              <div className=\"col-md-12\">\r\n                <h1 className=\"daily-headline\"><strong>Astronomy Picture of the Day:</strong></h1>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <hr />\r\n            <div className=\"row\">\r\n              <div className=\"col-md-4\">\r\n                <a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target='#modal' onClick={() => this.props.showModal({'isImage': this.state.isImage, 'modalUrl': this.state.hdUrl, 'modalAuthor': this.state.author })}>\r\n                  <img className=\"daily-image\" src={ this.state.url } alt={this.state.title} />\r\n                </a>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"col-md-8\">\r\n                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                  <h6><em>{this.state.date}</em></h6>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                  <h3>{this.state.title}</h3>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"row\">\r\n                  <p className=\"daily-description\">{ this.state.description }</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>            \r\n        :\r\n          <Loader />\r\n        }\r\n      </Fragment>\r\n    )\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Home;","import api from \"!../../../../../node_modules/style-loader/dist/runtime/injectStylesIntoStyleTag.js\";\n            import content from \"!!../../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js!./Mars.css\";\n\nvar options = {};\n\noptions.insert = \"head\";\noptions.singleton = false;\n\nvar update = api(content, options);\n\n\n\nexport default content.locals || {};","import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';\r\nimport { getConvertedDateString } from '../common/Common';\r\nimport { getMarsWeatherData } from '../apis/nasa';\r\nimport Loader from '../common/Loader';\r\nimport '../css/common/Common.css';\r\nimport '../css/tabs/Mars.css';\r\n\r\nclass Mars extends Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      weatherData: [],\r\n      isLoaded: false,\r\n      selectedSol: null,\r\n      selectedSolData: {},\r\n      selectedTemps: [],\r\n      selectedSpeeds: [],\r\n      selectedPressures: []\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.getMarsWeather();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  getMarsWeather = async () => {\r\n    try {\r\n      let weatherData = [];\r\n      const { data } = await getMarsWeatherData.get();\r\n      \r\n      Object.keys(data).forEach((key) => {\r\n        if (Number.isInteger(parseInt(key))) {\r\n          let solDataObj = {};\r\n          let sol = data[key];\r\n\r\n          for (const [metric, value] of Object.entries(sol)) {\r\n            switch(metric) {\r\n              case 'Season':\r\n                solDataObj['season'] = value;\r\n                break;\r\n              case 'First_UTC':\r\n                solDataObj['date_string'] = getConvertedDateString(value);\r\n                break;\r\n              case 'WD':\r\n                solDataObj['most_common_wind_direction'] = (value['most_common']) ? value['most_common']['compass_point'] : 'N/A';\r\n                break;\r\n              case 'AT':\r\n                delete value['ct'];\r\n                value['unit'] = '°C';\r\n                solDataObj[metric] = value;\r\n                break;\r\n              case 'HWS':\r\n                delete value['ct'];\r\n                value['unit'] = 'm/s';\r\n                solDataObj[metric] = value;\r\n                break;\r\n              case 'PRE':\r\n                delete value['ct'];\r\n                value['unit'] = 'Pa';\r\n                solDataObj[metric] = value;\r\n                break;\r\n              default:\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          weatherData.unshift({[key]: solDataObj});  \r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      let defaultSol = weatherData[0];\r\n\r\n      this.setState({\r\n        weatherData,\r\n        selectedSolData: defaultSol,\r\n        selectedSol: Object.keys(defaultSol)[0],\r\n        selectedTemps: (Object.values(defaultSol)[0]['AT'] == undefined) ?

The \"NASA\" page is\r\n                comprehensive searching tool of NASA's images and video archives and \"Techport\" is a page dedicated to highlighting some of NASA's\r\n                most interesting, current technologies being developed.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                <em>Read the latest article from the \r\n                  <a href=\"https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Hubble Space Telescope site</a>.\r\n                </em>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-4 about-column-image\">         \r\n              <a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#modal-1\">\r\n                <img \r\n                  className=\"about-image\" \r\n                  src=\"../../static/images/thumb_heic2021a.jpg\" \r\n                  alt='Hubble Identifies Strange Exoplanet That Behaves Like the Long-Sought “Planet Nine”.' \r\n                  onClick={(event) => this.onImageClick(event)} \r\n                  data-url=\"../../static/images/square_heic2021a.jpg\" \r\n                  data-author=\"Hubble Space Telescope\"\r\n                  data-number=\"1\"\r\n                />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <p className=\"about-title\">\r\n                <em>Hubble Identifies Strange Exoplanet That Behaves Like the Long-Sought “Planet Nine”.</em>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div className=\"container main-container\">\r\n          <div className=\"row\">\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-4 about-column-image\">\r\n              <a data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#modal-2\">\r\n                <img \r\n                  className=\"about-image\" \r\n                  src=\"../../static/images/finalsunshielddeploy7gunn.jpg\" \r\n                  alt='NASA’s Webb Sunshield Successfully Unfolds and Tensions in Final Tests.' \r\n                  onClick={(event) => this.onImageClick(event)} \r\n                  data-url=\"../../static/images/square_finalsunshielddeploy7gunn.jpg\" \r\n                  data-author=\"NASA Goodard\"\r\n                  data-number=\"2\"\r\n                />\r\n              </a>\r\n              <p className=\"about-title\">\r\n                <em>NASA’s Webb Sunshield Successfully Unfolds and Tensions in Final Tests.</em>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-8 about-section\">\r\n              <h4><strong>Django, React & Bootstrap</strong></h4><hr />\r\n              <p>\r\n                This website (version 2.0.1) was created with Python (version 3.8.0), Django (version 3.0.1), Bootstrap4, HTML5 and CSS3.\r\n                It consumes from various NASA and Hubble telescope APIs, using Python's requests library. This website was conceived as a project to learn more about Django\r\n                Full Stack Development, and pursue a life-long goal of learning more about astronomy. Originally, it was a blog project from an online course,\r\n                designed to demonstrate the basic MVT structure of Django. That component is now used to log the progress of this website's continous development,\r\n                as well as, journal various points of interest related to astronomy.

This bootcamp focused on the basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript)\r\n                and introduced us to many different Javascript libraries, like Node.js (a runtime environment), Mustache.js (a templating library) and React.js (a front-end framework). Additionally,\r\n                we were exposed to both MySQL and Mongo/Mongoose database management systems, JSON, AJAX, Bootstrap, Heroku and APIs. Future plans include experimenting with putting Angular and Java into\r\n                this architecture, as well as incorporating cloud development (most likely through AWS) when launching this website to its permanent online location.
